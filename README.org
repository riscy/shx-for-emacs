* Description
  /shx/ or "shell-extras" extends comint-mode in Emacs (e.g. =M-x shell=).

  It's compatible with any underlying REPL (zsh, bash, psql, ipython, etc.).

  It parses the output stream in a few useful ways:
  - *Display graphics and plots* in the shell with a simple markup
    language (e.g. =<view image.png>=)
  - *Add event-driven and timed behaviors* to any shell session
  - *Open any filename or URL* by arrowing up to it and pressing =RET= (shx will
    even try to guess the correct directory)
  - *Yank any line to the prompt* by arrowing up to it and pressing =C-RET=
  - *Check the time a command was run* by mousing over its prompt

  shx makes it easy to add new shell commands written in elisp.  Some are
  already built in:
  - =:clear= clears the buffer (like =clear= or =Command-K= on macOS)
  - =:e filename.txt= opens a file for editing
  - =:ssh user@host:port= starts a remote shell session using tramp
  - =:view image_file.png= embeds an image in the shell
  - =:plotline data_file.txt= embeds a line plot
  - etc.

  It also extends =shell-mode='s syntax highlighting, recenters and highlights
  content for better viewing when you run commands like ~comint-previous-prompt~
  and ~comint-kill-input~, and improves compatibility with =evil-mode= by
  anticipating when to switch to insert mode.

  Use =M-x shx RET= to start a new =shell= session with =shx-mode= enabled.

  /This version is tested with Emacs 26.1/.  Check out the [[https://github.com/riscy/shx-for-emacs/releases][release log]].
* Install
*** From MELPA
    =M-x package-install RET shx RET= to install =shx= from [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]].
*** Manually
    Add the following to your =.emacs=:
    #+begin_src elisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/shx/") ; add shx.el's directory to the load-path
    (require 'shx)                            ; load shell-extras
    #+end_src
* Setup
*** Quick-start
    Type =M-x shx RET=.  Try out the following commands:

    1. =:e ~/.bashrc= to edit your =.bashrc= (for example)
    2. =:man ls= to display the man page for =ls=
    3. =:help= to a start a completing read for other =shx= commands

*** Enable automatically
    If you like shx-mode, you can enable it everywhere:

    #+begin_src elisp
    (shx-global-mode 1)  ; toggle shx-mode on globally
    #+end_src

    Now shx will run automatically in any =comint-mode= buffer.  If you don't want
    shx to run in every comint-mode buffer, you can use =M-x shx-mode= on a
    case-by-case basis, or just add hooks to the mode in question, for example:

    #+begin_src elisp
    (add-hook 'inferior-python-mode-hook #'shx-mode)
    #+end_src
*** Customize
    Use =M-x customize-group RET shx RET= to see shx's many customization options.
    Here's an example customization using ~setq~:
    #+begin_src elisp
    (setq
      ;; vastly improve display performance by breaking up long output lines
      shx-max-output 1024
      ;; prevent input longer than macOS's typeahead buffer from going through
      shx-max-input 1024
      ;; prefer inlined images and plots to have a height of 250 pixels
      shx-img-height 250
      ;; don't show any incidental hint messages about how to use shx
      shx-show-hints nil
      ;; flash the previous comint prompt for a full second when using C-c C-p
      shx-flash-prompt-time 1.0
      ;; use `#' to prefix shx commands instead of the default `:'
      shx-leader "#")
    #+end_src
* Key bindings
  | Key binding | Description                                                              |
  |-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | =C-RET=     | If the cursor is not on the prompt, paste the current line to the input  |
  | =RET=       | If the cursor is on a filename or a URL, try to open it                  |
  | =SPC=       | If the prompt is =:=, send =SPC= straight through to the process         |
  | =q=         | If the prompt is =:=, send =q= straight through to the process           |

  Note the prompt will be =:= when reading through the output of =less= or a =man= page
  if you run the following:
  #+begin_src elisp
  (setenv "LESS" "--dumb --prompt=s")
  #+end_src
* Markup in the shell
  shx's markup can enhance basic command-line applications and drive other
  events.

  If the output ever contains =<view mountains.png>= on a line by itself, then a
  scaled rendering of =mountains.png= will be inlined within the text in the
  shell.  This works because =view= is a shx command.  shx will execute any
  (safe) shx command that appears with the following syntax:
  #+begin_src xml
  <command arg1 arg2 ...>
  #+end_src
  where =command= is a shx command and =arg1 ... argn= is a space-separated
  list of arguments.  Arguments don't need to be surrounded by quotes -- the
  command will figure out how to parse them.

  You can use this markup to create a barplot (=:plotbar=) after collecting some
  stats, or generate an =:alert= when a task is finished, and so forth.
* Extra shell commands
  shx's 'extra' commands are invoked by typing a =:= followed by the command's
  name.  (You can change the =:= prefix by customizing the ~shx-leader~
  variable.)  These commands are written in elisp and so can access all of
  Emacs' facilities.  Type =:help= to see a complete listing of shx commands.

  One command I use frequently is the =:edit= (shorthand =:e=) command:
  #+begin_src bash
  # edit the .emacs file:
  :edit ~/.emacs

  # use tramp to edit the .emacs file on a remote host:
  :e /remote-host.com:~/.emacs

  # edit a local file as root
  :sedit /etc/passwd
  #+end_src

  Thanks to [[https://github.com/CeleritasCelery][CeleritasCelery]] it's also possible to use environment variables in
  the argument list:
  #+begin_src bash
  :e $HOME/.emacs.d
  #+end_src
  (To see an environment variable's value, use ~(getenv "<var>")~.)

  I also use the =:kept= and =:keep= commands frequently:
  #+begin_src bash
  # write a complicated command:
  wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py && python get-pip.py

  # save the last command:
  :keep

  # search for commands having to do with pip:
  :kept pip
  #+end_src

  Because these commands are written in elisp, shx gives =M-x shell= a lot of
  the same advantages as =eshell=.  You can even evaluate elisp code directly in
  the buffer (see =:help eval=).

*** General commands
    | Command              | Description                                           |
    |----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
    | =:alert=             | Reveal the buffer with an alert.  Useful for markup   |
    | =:clear=             | Clear the buffer                                      |
    | =:date=              | Show the date (even when the process is blocked)      |
    | =:diff file1 file2=  | Launch an Emacs diff between two files                |
    | =:edit file=         | Edit a file.  Shortcut: =:e <file>=                   |
    | =:eval (elisp-sexp)= | Evaluate some elisp code.  Example: =:eval (pwd)=     |
    | =:find <filename>=   | Run a fuzzy-find for <filename>                       |
    | =:goto-url <url>=    | Completing-read for a URL                             |
    | =:header New header= | Change the current ~header-line-format~               |
    | =:kept regexp=       | Show a list of your 'kept' commands matching regexp   |
    | =:keep=              | Add the previous command to the list of kept commands |
    | =:man topic=         | Invoke the Emacs man page browser on a topic          |
    | =:ssh host=          | Open another shell on the specified host              |

    There are more than this -- type =:help= for a listing of all user commands.
*** Graphical commands
    | Command                      | Description            |
    |------------------------------+------------------------|
    | =:view image_file.jpg=       | Display an image       |
    | =:plotbar data_file.txt=     | Display a bar plot     |
    | =:plotline data_file.txt=    | Display a line plot    |
    | =:plotmatrix data_file.txt=  | Display a heatmap      |
    | =:plotscatter data_file.txt= | Display a scatter plot |
    | =:plot3d data_file.txt=      | Display a 3D plot      |

    These are for displaying inline graphics and plots in the shell buffer.  You
    can control how much vertical space an inline image occupies by customizing
    the ~shx-img-height~ variable.  Note =convert= (i.e. ImageMagick) and
    =gnuplot= need to be installed.  If the binaries are installed but these
    commands aren't working, customize the ~shx-path-to-convert~ and
    ~shx-path-to-gnuplot~ variables to point to the binaries.
*** Asynchronous commands
    | Command                           | Description                                       |
    |-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
    | =:delay <sec> <command>=          | Run a shell command after a specific delay        |
    | =:pulse <sec> <command>=          | Repeat a shell command forever with a given delay |
    | =:repeat <count> <sec> <command>= | Repeat a shell command =<count>= times            |
    | =:stop <num>=                     | Cancel a repeating or delayed command             |

    Use these to delay, pulse, or repeat a command a specific number of times.
    Unfortunately these only support your typical shell commands, and not shx's
    extra (colon-prefixed) commands.  So this possible:
    #+begin_src bash
    # Run the 'pwd' command 10 seconds from now:
    :delay 10 pwd
    #+end_src
    But this is not possible:
    #+begin_src bash
    # Run the 'pwd' shx command 10 seconds from now (DOES NOT WORK)
    :delay 10 :pwd
    #+end_src
*** Adding new commands
    New shx commands are written by defining single-argument elisp functions
    named ~shx-cmd-COMMAND-NAME~, where =COMMAND-NAME= is what the user would
    type to invoke it.
***** Example: a command to rename the buffer
    If you evaluate the following (or add it to your =.emacs=),
    #+begin_src elisp
    (defun shx-cmd-rename (name)
      "(SAFE) Rename the current buffer to NAME."
      (if (not (ignore-errors (rename-buffer name)))
          (shx-insert 'error "Can't rename buffer.")
        (shx-insert "Renaming buffer to " name "\n")
        (shx--hint "Emacs won't save buffers starting with *")))
    #+end_src
    then each shx buffer will immediately have access to the =:rename= command.
    When it's invoked, shx will also display a hint about buffer names.

    Note the importance of defining a docstring.  This documents the
    command so that typing =:help rename= will give the user information on what
    the command does.  Further, since the docstring begins with =(SAFE)=,
    it becomes part of shx's markup language.  So in this case if:
    #+begin_src xml
    <rename A new name for the buffer>
    #+end_src
    appears on a line by itself in the output, the buffer will try to
    automatically rename itself.
***** Example: invoking ediff from the shell
      A command similar to this one is built into shx:
      #+begin_src elisp
      (defun shx-cmd-diff (files)
        "(SAFE) Launch an Emacs `ediff' between FILES."
        (setq files (shx-tokenize files))
        (if (not (eq (length files) 2))
            (shx-insert 'error "diff <file1> <file2>\n")
          (shx-insert "invoking ediff...\n")
          (shx--asynch-funcall #'ediff (mapcar 'expand-file-name files))))
      #+end_src
      Note that =files= is supplied as a string, but it's immediately parsed
      into a list of strings using ~shx-tokenize~.  Helpfully, this function is
      able to parse various styles of quoting and escaping, for example
      `(shx-tokenize "'file one' file\\ two")`
      evaluates to
      `("file one" "file two")`.
***** Example: a command to browse URLs
      If you execute the following,
      #+begin_src elisp
      (defun shx-cmd-browse (url)
        "Browse the supplied URL."
        (shx-insert "Browsing " 'font-lock-keyword-face url)
        (browse-url url))
      #+end_src
      then each shx buffer will have access to the =:browse= command.

      Note the docstring does not specify that this command is =SAFE=.
      This means =<browse url>= will not become part of shx's markup.  That
      makes sense in this case, since you wouldn't want to give a process the
      power to open arbitrary URLs without prompting.
